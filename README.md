Fitness-Tracker is an applicatin that allows the user to track their daily cardio and resistance workouts. At the end of the workout the totals for duration, time, sets, reps, etc. are tallied and displayed to the user. Also, there is a tab that shows a graphical interface of the tracked workouts to the user; this is to show the workout trends of the user.

The application uses a MongoDB as the backend database and is manipulated with the Mongoose node package in order to create Schemas and perform CRUD applications for the tracker.

This was a fun project to work on, but not without it's challenges. For the life of me I could not figure out a weird undefined error I was receiving for the tallied duration. But overall I am content and happy with what I was able to do with this project and was very good practice using MongoDB, Mongoose, and deploying with Atlas.
